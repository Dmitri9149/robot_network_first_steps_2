Learn robot framework with 
[Introduction to robot framework](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/robot-framework-refresh/)    


I use Ubuntu (WSL 2 on Windows),    
and use ```poetry```    
```
Poetry will save the virtual enviroment in the .poetry/envs folder. You can change that setting and store your virtual environment in the project folder by running

poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```

Initialize project with 
```
poetry init
poetry add robotframework
pip install --upgrade robotframework-seleniumlibrary
```
